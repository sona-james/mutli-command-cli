## üí°Project Overview

In this assignment, I implemented 3 subcommands for the multi command CLI. The theme of my commands is calculators. All three of the subcommands I have implemented are calculators, which include: basic arithmetic calculator, final grade calculator, and age calculator.

-   [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Version Control System)

-   [GH CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (GitHub on the Command Line)

-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (Scientific and Publishing System)

-   [pyenv and Python](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation) (Python Version Management Tool)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build/Run the Project

**Cloning the Repository**

The following steps are done from the command line to clone the repository:

1.  Clone the repository using GH CLI:

    ``` bash
    gh repo clone sona-james/mutli-command-cli
    ```

2.  Navigate into the cloned repository:

    ``` bash
    cd sona-james/mutli-command-cli
    ```

**Testing**

To verify that the tools are working properly, follow these instructions to render the report qmd file.

1.  Navigate to the location where you cloned the repository, then install the dependicies.

    ``` bash
    poetry install
    ```

2.  Navigate to the location where you cloned the repository, then activate the virtual environment.

    ``` bash
    poetry shell
    ```

3. To get the list of the commands, run:

    ``` bash
    mytools
    ```

4. To run each of the commands (replace #nameofthecommand with the actual name):

    ``` bash
    mytools #nameofthecommand
    ```

***Optional***: Open the report file in VS Code:

1. Change the directory to the `./report` folder:

    ``` bash
    cd report
    ```

2. Open the file:

    ``` bash
    code ./report.qmd
    ```

3.  Render the report file to HTML:

    ``` bash
    quarto render ./report.qmd
    ```

The rendered HTML file will be saved in the `report` directory itself. You can open them from the command line using their filenames with the ***.html*** extension as shown below.

6.  Make sure you are still in the `./report` folder, then run the following command to open the ***.html*** version of the report file.

    ``` bash
    ./report.html
    ```
